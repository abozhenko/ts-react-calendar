Calendar widget based on Typescript + React
link to demo https://abozhenko.github.io/ts-react-calendar/

TODO:
1) Same size for a month and year view. Widget should not change size after switching the views
2) Keyboard navigation
3) Separate selected date from currently active (yar/month)
4) Increase area for forward/backward buttons on datepicker header. Currently, it is easy to misclick. Change symbols to icons probably.
5) Make it fancier. Handle hover, active events with visual effects, etc.
