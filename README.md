Calendar widget based on Typescript + React
link to demo https://abozhenko.github.io/ts-react-calendar/

TODO:
1) Same size for a month and year view. Widget should not change size after switching the views
2) Keyboard navigation
3) Separate selected date from currently active (yar/month), so that navigation between yars/months should not change selected date, until exect dey is selected. Use filled circle for selcted, and border circle for active.
4) Make it fancier. Handle hover, active events with visual effects, etc.
